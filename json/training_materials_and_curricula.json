The course focuses on core skills, from basic connection to a system, to laying the foundation for developing robust, high-quality code. We assume familiarity with desktop computers, but no prior programming, Linux or HPC experience is required.",

Or your research isn't reproducible or open enough? CodeRefinery understands and has free online courses and materials for you. We teach all the essential tools which are usually skipped in academic education so everyone can make full use of software, computing, and data with focus on reusability, reproducibility, and openness. We don't just give courses, but we are a training network that you can join to share the effort and bring better courses to your community. Our standard workshop is well known in Nordic academic circles and our engaging online teaching style is considered best-in-class even compared to in-person teaching. CodeRefinery is publicly funded and operates as a community project.",

The project will curate the material used in the INTERSECT workshops and training sessions while working with existing frameworks to provide an open-source platform that will allow for continued engagement with the training material and help coordinate the effort across the RSE-trainer community. In addition, INTERSECT will sponsor annual RSE-trainer workshops, focused on the curation and communal generation of training material. These workshops will connect RSE practitioner-instructors from across the country to not only leverage the knowledge of multiple institutions but also to build and strengthen the community of this group of software professionals.",

We’ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more! Students spend hundreds of hours using these tools over the course of their education (and thousands over their career), so it makes sense to make the experience as fluid and frictionless as possible. Mastering these tools not only enables you to spend less time on figuring out how to bend your tools to your will, but it also lets you solve problems that would previously seem impossibly complex.",
